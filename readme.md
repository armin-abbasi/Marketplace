## Basic Usage
Just run `php artisan db:seed`
and then you have three types of users  all with password of `123` :
<br><br>
`admin@local.com`<br>
`provider@local.com`<br>
`customer@local.com`
<br>
<br>
### Important Note!
In order to make providers capable of adding products you must create an store for them first (with their own user id).
